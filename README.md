# Project 1 : Market research analysis on condominium market in GTA | Self-guided project
Project Description: Developed a web-scraping model to extract listings data from a popular real estate website, Condos.ca (using Selenium API and BeautifulSoup in Python) to perform real estate market research 

Acitivites/:
- The listings data collected spanned for more than 2000 condos and involved information on important parameters affecting condo prices such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, maintenance fees, etc.
- Performed in-depth exploratory analysis on the resulting data frame using Python libraries as well as statistical methods to analyze important metrics on pricing; estimated $ per sq. ft figures, and validated results (based on market intelligence provided by the website) within an error value of 8%. 
- Article published in Towards Data Science (one of the most read Medium publications and one of the most popular data science blogs in the world)


# Project 2 : Churn Analytics in Telecom | Self-guided Project
Project Description: Developed a classification machine learning model to predict customer churn in the telecom industry

Activities:
- Performed all steps including (i) business problem definition, (ii) data inspection/cleaning, EDA(using Tableau and Python libraries), (iii) clustering analysis (using PCA & KMeans), (iv) feature engineering/variable reduction, (v) model training & validation (using Logistic Regression, Random Forest) with a recall rate of 80% on testing data and (vi) model interpretation (using Lime and lift curve/decile analysis) to identify the top drivers of churn and create customer profiles/segments based on the probability of churn

# Project 3: Melborne House Price Prediction | Self-guided Project
Project Description: Developed a Linear Regression Model to predict house prices in Melbourne city and identify significant variables
Activities:
- Performed an in-depth EDA to capture price trends by predictor variables from data spanning 14000 listings
- Model predicts price variable with R2 score of 0.71; results validated and interpreted using decile analysis
